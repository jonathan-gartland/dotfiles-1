r"""FastImport Plugin
=================

The fastimport plugin provides stream-based importing of data into Bazaar.
A bzr-fast-export.py script is also included providing exporting of data
out of Bazaar to the same format. As well as enabling interchange between
multiple VCS tools, fastimport/export can be useful for complex branch
operatons, e.g. partitioning off part of a code base in order to Open
Source it.

The normal import recipe is::

  bzr init-repo .
  front-end | bzr fast-import -

Numerous front-ends are provided in the exporters directory where
the plugin is installed. The list of known front-ends and their
status is documented on http://bazaar-vcs.org/BzrFastImport/FrontEnds.
For further details, see http://bazaar-vcs.org/BzrFastImport and the
online help for the commands::

  bzr help fast-import
  bzr help fast-import-info
  bzr help fast-import-filter

class cmd_fast_import(Command):
    """Backend for fast Bazaar data importers.

    This command reads a mixed command/data stream and
    creates branches in the current repository accordingly.
    To specify standard input as the input stream, use a
    source name of '-'.
    
    The usual recipe is::

      bzr init-repo .
      front-end | bzr fast-import -

    If run inside a branch using a shared repository, then
    the current branch is made the trunk and other branches,
    if any, are created in sister directories. If run inside
    a standalone tree, the current branch is also made the
    trunk, but warnings are output about other branches found.
    
    The stream format is upwardly compatible with git-fast-import
    so existing front-ends for that tool can typically be reused
    without changes. See http://bazaar-vcs.org/BzrFastImport for
    links to matching exporters from Subversion, CVS, Git,
    Mercurial, Darcs, Perforce and SCCS.
 
    While reusing an existing format with existing frontends is
    great, it does mean a slightly more complex recipe when
    importing large projects via exporters that reuse blob data
    across commits, namely::

      bzr init-repo .
      front-end > xxx.fi
      bzr fast-import-info -v xxx.fi > xxx.cfg
      bzr fast-import xxx.fi --info xxx.cfg

    In this scenario, the xxx.cfg file generated by the first pass
    holds caching hints that the second pass uses to lower memory
    usage.
    
    At checkpoints and on completion, the commit-id -> revision-id
    map is saved to a file called 'fastimport-id-map' in the control
    directory for the repository (e.g. .bzr/repository). If the import
    is interrupted or unexpectedly crashes, it can be started again
    and this file will be used to skip over already loaded revisions.
    As long as subsequent exports from the original source begin
    with exactly the same revisions, you can use this feature to
    maintain a mirror of a repository managed by a foreign tool.
    If and when Bazaar is used to manage the repository, this file
    can be safely deleted.

    If you wish to write a custom exporter for your project, see
    http://bazaar-vcs.org/BzrFastImport for the detailed protocol
    specification. In many cases, exporters can be written quite
    quickly using whatever scripting/programming language you like.

    Examples::

     cd /git/repo/path
     git-fast-export --signed-tags=warn | bzr fast-import -

        Import a Git repository into Bazaar.

     svn-fast-export.py /svn/repo/path | bzr fast-import -

        Import a Subversion repository into Bazaar.

     hg-fast-export.py -r /hg/repo/path | bzr fast-import -

        Import a Mercurial repository into Bazaar.
